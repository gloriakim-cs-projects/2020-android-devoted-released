**Fully Completed**

- Main (except Setting)
- Note
- Alarm
- Notification
- Record

- one CONTROLLER VARIABLE reading_plan

**Need to Complete (Partially Completed)**

- Brief instructions to use
- Main's Setting
- Refresh Bible fragment (my note part)
- Public note --> (1) resets the public note every time (2) display in a weird way. need to remove [] (3) need to display right away
- once the alarm is set, the first verse needs to show right away when the app is reopened (creating the last CONTROLLER VARIABLE reading_day to do this.)

**Removed Feature**

- Because NIV is not freely available and KJV is difficult to understand, I simply removed the entire Bible fragment.
- Having several Alarm Managers causes the app stops. I removed the option of choosing days, hoping users are committed reading the Bible every day. 

**Need Help**
- I successfully retrieved data from Firebase, but I cannot show the data using listview.
